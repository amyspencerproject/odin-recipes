  Apple chutney is a great companion for so many dishes — use it to glaze pork
  chops or serve with a selection of cold meats and cheese. It's delicious on
  baked Brie!

  <li>
    Place apples, onion, ginger, vinegar, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon,
    white pepper, cardamom, and nutmeg into a large saucepan; bring to a boil,
    stirring often. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring frequently,
    until the apples are tender, about 30 minutes. Add some water if necessary
    to keep the ingredients moist.

    Remove onion and ginger if you like; let the chutney cool, then transfer
    into a sterilized jar or container, seal, and store in the refrigerator
    until ready to serve.
