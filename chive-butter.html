    <p>
      This chive compound butter is a great way to use an herb that just keeps
      giving all summer long. It goes great on grilled steak, baked potatoes,
      grilled corn, or any grilled vegetable.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place butter in a small bowl at room temperature until soft, about 1
        hour; add chives and salt. Using a silicone spatula, mix until evenly
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay a large piece of plastic wrap on a clean work surface; place butter
        in the middle. Lift one side of plastic and roll to slowly form a log
        shape. Press the sides in and continue to roll. Twist the sides up to
        seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate butter for 1 hour before using. Slice into rounds and serve
        over desired food.
      </li>
    </ol>
